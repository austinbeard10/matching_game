# matching_game
My goals for this project was to create a matching game. 
I wanted to use pictures and match the pictures together but I wasn't able to figure that code out.
I created a button based matching game that has you match two number together.
You click on a square then a number pops up and you click on another square to see if it matches.
I used lists to create my board and randomly place numbers behind the buttons.
Have the user click the buttons too reveal the numbers. 
My proccess was to create the board, randomize the numbers behind them, make those lists equal to each other.
I learned how to use lists better.
I got stuck with trying to use the lists. 
I would try to incorporate the sprites, instead of text.
I got a little bit away from the game design but I still had the core idea in place. The graphics where just not the same. 
I stayed on track by looking at my game document.
